# A Home For All Structures of Data
My personal collection of all things data structures, basic use-cases, accompanying algorithms and implementations. Most importantly, I hope to learn a TON about the science of computing and expand my experience with some of the most crucial innovations in the past 50 years.

### An Explanation
I am using this repository as a place of reference for the data types that I have implemented from scratch. To start, I am focusing on the high-level architecture that I feel I lack in Python, like classes, inheritance, public/private variables, and a few minor intracacies that I have missed in my experience with Python thus far.

### Further Nonsensical Explanations
As I spend more time writing in JavaScript, I plan on coming back to these data structures to reimplement them in a web-friendly manner, or to compare the differences between a Native vs. Web-based language, and how they interact with common data structures and their respective implementations.


### Next Up
As a challenge in the absense of a formal degree, I am pushing myself to implement all of these systems from scratch, with little support other than a similar set of resources that I would have been provided with in academia. Along with this, I plan on implementing each of these into a meaningful project, in one way or another, to allow for much needed growth in my experience with advanced algorithms and thinking through real-world problems with a fine-tuned lense.
